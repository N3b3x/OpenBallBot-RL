## 🔬 Real-World Project: Ballbot RL

Throughout these tutorials, we use the **Ballbot RL** project as our primary example. The Ballbot is a dynamically balanced mobile robot that:

- Moves on a ball using three omniwheels
- Maintains balance while navigating terrain
- Uses RGB-D cameras for visual perception
- Learns directional locomotion via RL

**Key Files:**
- `ballbot_gym/bbot_env.py` - Main environment implementation
- `ballbot_gym/terrain.py` - Terrain generation
- `ballbot_gym/Rewards.py` - Reward functions
- `ballbot_rl/policies/policies.py` - Multi-modal feature extractor
- `ballbot_rl/visualization/plot_training.py` - Training progress visualization
- `ballbot_rl/visualization/visualize_env.py` - Environment visualization
- `ballbot_rl/visualization/visualize_model.py` - Model visualization
- `ballbot_rl/visualization/browse_environments.py` - Interactive environment browser

## 📐 Mathematical Notation

Throughout these tutorials, we use standard mathematical notation:

- **Vectors**: Bold lowercase (e.g., **a**, **s**)
- **Matrices**: Bold uppercase (e.g., **A**, **R**)
- **Scalars**: Italic (e.g., *r*, *γ*)
- **Sets**: Calligraphic (e.g., 𝒜, 𝒮)
- **Functions**: Standard (e.g., *f*(*x*), *π*(*a*|*s*))

## 💡 Key Principles

### **1. Normalization is Critical**
> "Normalization is not just a convenience—it's a necessity for stable learning."  
> — *Common wisdom in deep RL*

All observations and actions should be normalized to consistent ranges.

### **2. Design for Real Robots**
> "If you wouldn't have it on a real robot, don't put it in simulation."  
> — *Sergey Levine, UC Berkeley*

Only include sensors and actuators that exist in the real system.

### **3. Reward Engineering Matters**
> "The reward function is the most important hyperparameter."  
> — *Pieter Abbeel, UC Berkeley*

Spend time designing good reward functions—they shape everything.

### **4. Partial Observability is the Norm**
> "Real-world robotics is fundamentally partially observable."  
> — *Chelsea Finn, Stanford*

Design observations assuming the agent doesn't see everything.
