The Ballbot: An Omnidirectional Balancing
Mobile Robot
Umashankar Nagarajan, George Kantor, and Ralph Hollis

Abstract—The ballbot is a human-sized dynamically
stable mobile robot that balances on a single ball. Unlike
statically stable mobile robots, the ballbot is tall and narrow
with a high center of gravity and a small footprint. Moreover, its dynamic stability enables it to be physically interactive. These characteristics make it better suited to navigate
and interact in cluttered human environments. This paper
presents the evolved hardware design of the ballbot with
a four-wheel inverse mouse-ball drive to actuate the ball,
and a yaw drive mechanism that enables unlimited rotation
about its vertical axis. The ballbot also has a triad of legs
that provide static stability when powered down. This paper
presents a detailed description of the ballbot’s control
architecture, and it presents several experimental results
that demonstrate its balancing and locomotion capabilities.
This paper also presents a trajectory planning algorithm
that plans for body lean motions, which when tracked result
in the desired rest-to-rest motions of the robot. Finally,
the paper illustrates some interesting human-robot physical
interaction behaviors that can be achieved as a result of
the ballbot’s dynamic stability.

I. I NTRODUCTION
There are a number of challenges in building wheeled
mobile robots that will operate and interact in human
environments. One of the fundamental challenges is
in locomotion and navigation. Traditionally, wheeled
robots have been statically stable, while recently, more
groups have been interested in developing dynamically
stable wheeled robots that actively balance. The work
presented in this paper aims at exploring the feasibility
of developing dynamically stable mobile robots that
are human-sized, dynamically agile, slender enough to
easily maneuver cluttered environments and readily yield
when pushed. This paper presents the ballbot, shown
in Fig. 1, which is the first successful single-wheeled,
omnidirectional balancing mobile robot to the best of
our knowledge (Lauwers et al. 2005). The ballbot was
developed as a simple test bed to study locomotion and
physical interaction characteristics of balancing mobile
robots in human environments.

Balancing robots have underlying dynamic properties
that can be exploited in order to carry out agile, efficient
motion. Balancing robots can be tall enough to interact
with people at eye level, narrow enough to easily negotiate cluttered environments, and they can move with
speed and agility comparable to that of humans. They
are also capable of safe and gentle physical interaction.
To understand why balancing robots offer a revolutionary departure from traditional statically stable mobile
robots one must consider that statically stable (nonbalancing) robots of the traditional variety generally have
multiple wheels or treads. When at rest, the gravitational
vector from the robot’s center of mass must pass through
the base of support. When the robot accelerates, the
vector sum of its acceleration and gravity vectors must
be encompassed by the base to avoid tipping. If the
statically stable robot is tall, has heavy arms, or carries a
heavy payload it becomes much more difficult to avoid
potentially disastrous tipping.
In 2005, we introduced the ballbot, a dynamically
stable mobile robot moving on a single spherical wheel
(Lauwers et al. 2005), and it was popularized in (Hollis
2006; Lauwers et al. 2006). Unlike its two-wheeled
counterparts, the single spherical wheel provides omnidirectional motion making the ballbot more suitable
for navigation in human environments with constrained
spaces. Moreover, the ballbot is tall and narrow, which
enhances its ability to interact with human environments.

In (Hollis 2006; Lauwers et al. 2006, 2005), we presented the first version of the ballbot with preliminary
results of its balancing behavior. It used an inverse
mouse-ball drive with only two active motors to drive
the ball, which resulted in an undesirable “hopping motion.” Although its controller was capable of balancing
the robot reasonably well, it was not robust to large
disturbances. Moreover, it produced jerky motions while
tracking desired ball motions.

interactions with balancing robots like the ballbot. This
paper is an improved version of the work presented in
(Nagarajan et al. 2009a,b,c).

A. Balancing Mobile Robots
The idea of balancing with wheeled robots has been
around for some time. Of course the cart-pendulum
system has long been considered as a canonical problem in the controls literature, but one of the first real
two-wheeled inverted-pendulum type mobile robot was
designed and controlled in (Ha and Yuta 1997). Twowheeled balancing robots became popular especially
after the introduction of the Segway RMP (Nguyen et al.
2004). Dean Kamen introduced iBot (iBOT 2003), a twowheeled balancing wheelchair, and Anybots introduced
a balancing tele-presence robot on two wheels (Anybots
2010). Rod Grupen and his group introduced uBot (Deegan et al. 2006), a two-wheeled dynamic mobile manipulation platform and showed that balancing robots can be
effective mobile manipulators (Deegan et al. 2008). Mike
Stilman introduced Golem Krang (Stilman et al. 2010),
a two-wheeled balancing mobile manipulator that can
autonomously stand and sit. Such two-wheeled balancing
platforms have dominated the field of dynamically stable
mobile robots, but they have kinematic constraints (i.e.,
wheels that cannot slip sideways) that restrict their
direction of motion. Moreover, they balance in only one
vertical plane and are statically stable in the other. On the
contrary, single-wheeled balancing mobile robots like the
ballbot (Hollis 2006) balance in both the vertical planes
and are omnidirectional in motion.

A. Contributions
This paper exclusively deals with the design and
operation of the ballbot, which is the first successful ball
balancing robot to the best of our knowledge. The ballbot
was designed as a simple test bed to study locomotion
and interaction characteristics of balancing mobile robots
in human environments. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of developing such simple balancing platforms,
and highlights the advantages of balancing robots. It also
discusses the drawbacks and the challenges that need to
be addressed in developing balancing mobile robots.
This paper presents an evolved version of the ballbot
with a four-motor inverse mouse-ball drive, wherein all
four rollers driving the ball are active. This arrangement
overcame the undesirable “hopping motion” that was
observed in (Hollis 2006; Lauwers et al. 2006, 2005).
This evolved version included a yaw drive mechanism
that enabled the ballbot to rotate about its vertical axis.
This paper presents a detailed description of the entire
improved control architecture of the ballbot, including
balancing control, stationkeeping and velocity control,
leg control, and yaw control. It presents controllers
that enable the ballbot to successfully transition from a
statically stable state (SSS) to a dynamically stable state
(DSS) and vice versa. Unlike in (Hollis 2006; Lauwers
et al. 2006, 2005), the balancing controller presented
here enables the ballbot to be robust to large disturbances, including shoves and kicks, and also collisions
against walls and tables.
This paper also presents an offline trajectory planning
algorithm that plans body lean trajectories so as to move
the robot to a desired position on the floor while satisfying the dynamic constraints associated with balancing.
The trajectory planner and the control architecture enable
the ballbot to achieve good tracking of desired ball motions, and do not produce jerky motions as was observed
in (Hollis 2006; Lauwers et al. 2006, 2005). This paper
presents experimental results of the ballbot achieving
smooth rest-to-rest motions on the floor. Finally, the
paper demonstrates how properties of dynamic stability
naturally provide for safe, useful human-robot physical

B. Single-wheeled Omnidirectional Balancing Robots
Since the introduction of the ballbot at Carnegie
Mellon University in 2005, several other groups around
the world have also begun to explore and build singlewheel omnidirectional balancers (Havasi 2005; Kumagai
and Ochiai 2008, 2009; Rezero 2010). In 2005, Laszlo
Havasi from Hungary independently developed another
ball balancing robot called ERROSphere (Havasi 2005).
However, the robot did not balance reliably and there was
no further work presented. In 2008, Masaaki Kumagai
developed a ball balancing robot called BallIP (Kumagai
and Ochiai 2008) at Tohoku Gakuin University, and his
group demonstrated its capability to carry loads and
achieve cooperative transportation (Kumagai and Ochiai
2009). In 2010, a group of mechanical engineering
students at ETH Zurich developed a ball balancing robot
called Rezero (Rezero 2010).

The fundamental difference between the ballbot (Hollis 2006), and the other successful ball balancing
robots (Kumagai and Ochiai 2008; Rezero 2010) is in
the actuator mechanism for the ball. The ballbot (Hollis
2006) uses an inverse mouse-ball drive with four motors
(see Sec. III-A), whereas both BallIP (Kumagai and
Ochiai 2008) and Rezero (Rezero 2010) use omniwheels
with three motors to drive the ball. Ordinary omniwheels
produce unsteady rolling and hence, a complex and
expensive omniwheel with continuous circumferential
contact line was used for BallIP (Kumagai and Ochiai
2008). The same omniwheel design was adopted later
in Rezero. Unlike the ballbot that needs a slip-ring
assembly and a separate motor for unlimited yaw rotation
(see Sec. III-B), the omniwheel balancers like BallIP and
Rezero can move and yaw using just the three motors. A
detailed analysis and comparison of the inverse mouseball drive and tri-omniwheel drive mechanisms is yet
to be done. In terms of control, BallIP uses a velocity
control strategy on their omniwheels instead of torque
control. This is due to two reasons, one is that they use
stepper motors to actuate the omniwheels, and the other
is that the velocity control strategy better handles the
case where the omniwheel loses contact with the ball.

proposed for the actuated joint of the 2R underactuated
manipulator with zero gravity in order to achieve desired
configurations of the system. In this paper, we use a
similar class of parametric trajectories for the unactuated
joint of the ballbot as will be described in Sec. VI.
III. T HE BALLBOT P LATFORM
The ballbot, shown in Fig. 1, is a reconfigurable cylindrical platform resting atop a ball. The body is 1.41 m
tall, weighs 55 kg and has an outer diameter of 0.37 m.
The ballbot was intentionally built to be of human size
so that it can interact with human environments similar
to the way humans do. Three aluminium channels, held
together by circular decks, define the structure of the
ballbot’s body. Three retractable legs are attached to
the lower part of these channels and are deployed to
provide static stability when powered down. The ball
is a 0.185 m diameter hollow aluminium sphere coated
with a 13.5 mm thick layer of urethane. The body hosts
a 48V lead acid battery, its charger and a single board
computer on its top decks. An inertial measurement unit
(IMU) sits on top of the ball drive unit and provides
Kalman-filtered body angles and rates w.r.t. gravity.
A. Inverse Mouse-ball Drive

C. Underactuated Systems

The ballbot uses an inverse mouse-ball drive to actuate
the ball. Figure 2(a) shows the ball drive mechanism,
which is essentially the inverse of a computer mouse. In a
traditional computer mouse, the rolling ball drives rollers
to produce computer input, whereas here, the rollers
drive the ball to produce motion. Our previous version
of the inverse mouse-ball drive (IMB) (Lauwers et al.
2006) had a pair of drive and opposing passive rollers
for each of the orthogonal motion directions. This setup
caused the rollers to produce an upward or downward
force on the ball in addition to the torque, which resulted
in an undesirable “hopping motion.” The present design
circumvents this problem by actuating all four rollers
with individual DC servomotors that exert pure torques
on the ball. The motors have 1024 cpr encoders attached
to their shafts that measure ball rotation. A detailed paper
describing the IMB is in preparation (Hollis et al.).

Balancing robots are underactuated systems, i.e., systems with fewer independent control inputs than the
number of degrees of freedom (Spong 1998). Underactuated balancing systems have constraints on their dynamics that restrict the family of configuration trajectories
that they can follow. These constraints are called secondorder nonholonomic (non-integrable) constraints (Ray
1966) or dynamic constraints. The past few decades have
seen a lot of interest in trajectory planning and control
for such systems.
Underactuated systems with dynamic constraints have
been approached from the controls perspective (e.g.,
acrobot swing-up (Spong 1995)) as well as from the
planning perspective (e.g., airship path planning (Kim
and Ostrowski 2003)). A detailed analysis of underactuated manipulators with passive joints is presented
in (Oriolo and Nakamura 1991). Olfati-Saber presented
explicit cascade normal forms for different classes of
underactuated mechanical systems and also presented
partial feedback linearization techniques for controlling
them (Olfati-Saber 2001). In (Rosas et al. 2001), the
trajectory planning problem of an underactuated planar
2R manipulator is solved using offline planned trajectories, which are constructed with smooth sinusoids.
In (Rosas et al. 2002), a class of parametric trajectories is

B. Yaw Mechanism
A large thin-section bearing attaches the ball drive
mechanism to the body and allows yaw rotation. The
yaw drive consists of a DC servomotor with planetary
gears driving a pulley assembly at the center as shown in
Fig. 2(b). The orientation of the body frame with respect
to the ball drive unit is given by an absolute encoder

The ballbot is modeled as a rigid cylinder on top of a
rigid sphere. A simplified planar model of the ballbot
is used for both control and trajectory planning. The
planar model assumes that: (i) there is no slip between
the spherical wheel and the floor, (ii) the motion in the
median sagital plane and the median coronal plane is
decoupled, (iii) the equations of motion in these two
planes are identical, and (iv) the floor is assumed to be
flat and level. With these assumptions, we design two
decoupled, independent planar controllers and trajectory
planners for the 3D system.
The stabilizing controllers for the ballbot presented in
Sec. V are designed as linear controllers. The linearized
dynamics of the full 3D ballbot system about the origin is
decoupled between the two orthogonal planes of motion,
which validates the use of decoupled planar models
for linear control design. In the full 3D ballbot model,
the coupling terms between the two orthogonal planes
of motion contain products of sine of the body lean
angles, and hence, for small lean angles, the dynamics
of two decoupled planar models well approximate the
dynamics of the full 3D model. The trajectory planner
presented in Sec. VI uses the nonlinear dynamics of
the planar ballbot model to plan body lean motions that
achieve desired rest-to-rest motions. In this work, we are
interested only in simple planar rest-to-rest motions, and
hence, the planar ballbot model is sufficient to capture
the dynamics of the system. A detailed presentation of
more sophisticated planning approaches that use the 3D
ballbot model is in review (Nagarajan and Hollis 2013).

unlimited yaw rotation.
C. Legs
Each leg is 0.48 m long and is attached to a linear
screw drive with a ratio of 1.6 mm/revolution. The legs
are independently driven by three DC servomotors with
500 cpr encoders. Each leg has a hoof switch and a ball
castor at its tip. The hoof switches are spring loaded
and are used to detect contact with the floor, whereas
the ball castors allow the legs to slide on a smooth floor.

A. Planar Ballbot Model
A ball rolling on a plane has five configurations, two
configurations for the ball position and three configurations for the ball orientation. However, in this work,
we are interested only in the position of the ball and
not in its orientation. Figure 4 shows the planar model
of the ballbot used in this work along with this planar
configurations. The origin of the world frame is fixed to
the initial position of the center of the ball. Since we have
assumed a flat and level floor, the horizontal position of
the center of the ball xw matches the horizontal position
of the ball’s contact point on the floor. The body axis of
the robot is given by the line connecting the center of the
ball to the center of mass (CM) of the body. The body
angle ω is defined as the angle between the vertical and
the body axis, and it is directly measured by the IMU.

Please refer to Table I for the other symbols.
As described in Sec. III-A, a pair of active opposing
rollers drive the ball in each of the orthogonal motion
directions. For each orthogonal motion direction, the ball

where rr is the radius of the roller, rw is the radius of

motors. In the current setup, the amplifiers that drive the
opposing motors are hardwired to command the same
torque, i.e., τm1 = τm2 .

Fig. 4. Planar ballbot model with body angle φ and ball position xw .
The ball angular configuration θ is chosen such that xw = rw (θ + φ).

The angular configuration θ of the ball is chosen such
that the horizontal position of the ball xw w.r.t. the world
frame is given by xw = rw (θ+ω), where rw is the radius
of the ball and the ball configuration θ ∈ [−∞, ∞].
There are two advantages in choosing this coordinate for
the ball configuration: one is that the ball configuration
θ directly corresponds to the encoder readings on the
ball motors, and the other is that this coordinate choice
allows one to remove the input coupling between the ball
and the body from the equations of motion.
The dynamic equations of motion of the planar ballbot model1 , shown in Fig. 4, are derived using EulerLagrange equations. The equations of motion can be
written in matrix form as follows:

B. Parameter Estimation
In order to facilitate the mathematical model to better
represent the robot dynamics, various offline experiments
were conducted to determine the principal system parameters. Compared to (Nagarajan et al. 2009c), this paper
presents a more detailed description of the parameter
estimation experiments and the results obtained.
1) Inertia Measurement: The moments of inertia of
the ballbot’s body were determined experimentally using
a torsional pendulum setup (Wang et al. 2007). The
body was suspended perpendicular to its length about
its center of mass using a torsional spring as shown in
Fig. 5, and the oscillations were observed after an initial
disturbance.
The resulting angular velocity trajectories from the
IMU shown in Fig. 6 were used to find the natural
frequency of oscillation. The spring constant of the
torsional pendulum was obtained by performing the same
experiment with an I-beam whose inertia was calculated
from its shape and material density. The torsional spring
constant K is given by

where q = [θ, ω]T is the generalized coordinate vector,
M (q) is the mass/inertia matrix, C(q, q̇) is the vector
of coriolis and centrifugal forces, G(q) is the vector of
gravitational forces, D(q̇) is the frictional torque vector
and τ is the torque applied between the ball and the body
in the direction normal to the plane. The expressions for
the above mentioned terms are given below:

The moment of inertia about the vertical axis
was determined by a similar experiment with the body
suspended vertically. The measured moment of inertia
values are shown in Table I.
2) Friction Modeling: The coulomb friction torque
and the viscous friction coefficient were experimentally
determined using the setup shown in Fig. 7, where the
ballbot stood on a roller ball with its body constrained
vertically. A ramp current input of slope m was given to
the ball drive motors and the angular velocity of the ball
was recorded. The minimum current required to start the
ball rolling is called the breakaway current, which when
multiplied by the torque constant Ki of the drive unit
gives the coulomb friction torque Dc . The experiment
was repeated with the current vector at 5◦ intervals.
After breakaway, the equation of motion of the ball
can be written as

A. Balancing Control

Time (s)

The objective of the balancing controller is to balance
the body about the desired angles, i.e., roll and pitch
angles. The desired body angles will be zero for a pure
balancing operation, i.e., standing still and non-zero in
order to move around (Nagarajan et al. 2009a). The
balancing controller consists of two independent controllers, one for each of the vertical planes. Each one is a
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller whose
gains were tuned manually. The balancing controller,
shown in the shaded part of Fig. 10, attempts to track
the desired center of mass projection on the floor.
While balancing, the body angles remain within ±0.1◦
as shown in the plot for the pitch angle in Fig. 11(a).
Similar results were obtained for the roll angle. The
XY plot of the ball position on a carpeted floor under
the action of just the balancing controller is shown in
Fig. 11(b). The ball position was obtained using the data
from the encoders on the ball motors. Even though the
balancing controller does not attempt to maintain its ball
position, the ball remains within ±20 mm of its starting
point on the floor. However, it is to be noted that the
robot was not disturbed during this operation.

1) Stationkeeping Control: Stationkeeping is the act
of balancing at a desired ball position sd even when
disturbed. The position of the ball on the floor is given
by s = rw (θ + ω). The stationkeeping controller is
a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller that outputs
desired body angles depending on the error between the
ball’s current and desired positions. The PD controller’s
angle outputs are saturated to avoid large lean angles
and its gains were tuned manually. The XY plot of the
robot’s ball position under the action of balancing and
stationkeeping controllers are shown in Fig. 12(a) and
Fig. 12(b) respectively. Here, the ballbot was pushed
by a human with about 20 N force for 0.5 s. While
using the balancing controller, the ballbot comes to
rest about 0.2 m from its initial position (Fig. 12(a)),
whereas the stationkeeping controller successfully brings
the robot to rest at its initial position even when disturbed
(Fig. 12(b)). The ball position was obtained from the
encoders on the ball motors. The companion video (Extension 1) shows the ballbot successfully stationkeeping
when subjected to human pushes.
2) Velocity Control: The velocity controller is a manually tuned Proportional-Integral (PI) controller that outputs desired body angles depending on the error between
the ball’s current and desired velocities. The velocity

The balancing controller is good at balancing about
the desired body angles but does not achieve any desired
ball position or velocity on the floor. This is achieved
by using an outer control loop around the balancing
controller, as shown for the stationkeeping controller in
Fig. 10. The outer loop controller provides the desired

legs-down controller has an inner PI control loop that
feeds back the leg velocity and an outer PD control loop
that feeds back both position and velocity of the leg
similar to that of the yaw controller in Fig. 13. The legs
on the ballbot were not designed to snap up and down,
and they are not strong enough to hold a falling robot.
A combination of PI and PD control loops are used to
regulate their velocities in order to minimize damage
from hitting the body and the ground from legs-up and
legs-down operations respectively. The three legs have
independent controllers so that they can handle cases
where the ballbot balances on a non-level floor.

controller is concerned only with the ball velocity ṡ and
not its position s. The velocity controller has two major
applications, one as a stopping controller that enables the
ballbot to slow down and come to rest when subjected
to large disturbances; and the other for teleoperation
wherein the user can provide velocity commands using a
joystick. The angle outputs from the velocity controller
are saturated to avoid large lean angles.

The ballbot is in a dynamically stable state (DSS)
when it is balancing on the ball and it is in a statically
stable state (SSS) when it rests on its three legs. In order
to be autonomous, the ballbot must have the capability
to automatically transition between SSS and DSS. The
ballbot must simultaneously use the legs-up controller
and the balancing controller to automatically transition
from SSS to DSS. This can create large, undesirable
transients if the body angles are large when in SSS. The
body angles will not be close to zero especially when the
robot is on a non-level floor. In order to avoid this, we
use a legs-adjust controller, shown in Fig. 15, to adjust
the position of the legs tilting the body close to vertical
when in SSS.

C. Yaw Control
The yaw controller, shown in Fig. 13, is decoupled
from the balancing controller and consists of two loops:
an inner Proportional-Integral (PI) control loop that feeds
back the yaw angular velocity ψ̇ and an outer PD control
loop that feeds back both the yaw angle ψ and the
yaw angular velocity ψ̇. The yaw angle ψ is obtained
by integrating the yaw angular velocity ψ̇ data from
the IMU. The output from the outer-loop PD controller
is saturated to avoid high desired angular velocities.
The PI loop also relies on output saturation and does
not use anti-windup logic. When the body yaws, the
IMU attached to the body frame rotates, whereas the
ball drive unit does not. Hence, the body angles are
transformed from the body frame to the drive unit frame
using the angle offset provided by the absolute yaw
encoder. A successful 360◦ yaw rotation of the ballbot
while balancing is shown in Fig. 14, and its video can
be found in Extension 1.

When the three legs are down and remain down, the
ballbot forms an overconstrained spatial linkage. The
ballbot’s top view with all the legs deployed, shown in
Fig. 16(a), suggests that the motion of leg 1 will only
affect the pitch angle and not the roll angle, whereas the
motion of legs 2 and 3 will affect both. Figure 16(b)

shows a graph of the leg 1 position as a function of the
body pitch angle. Similar graphs hold for legs 2 and 3.
The relationship between leg position ξ and body angle
ω is approximately linear of the form ξ = Kleg ω + cleg .
The legs-adjust controller uses the linear relationship
between body angles and leg positions to achieve body
angles close to zero when the ballbot is in SSS. After
such an operation, the legs-up controller and the balancing controller can be simultaneously used to achieve
smoother automatic transition from SSS to DSS. The
transition is said to be smooth if the discontinuity in
the body angle trajectory is small and the resulting ball
velocity upon transition is also small.
Figure 17 shows experimental results on the ballbot
with and without the use of legs adjust controller before
transitioning from SSS to DSS. It can be seen from
Fig. 17(a) that the use of legs adjust controller moved
the body angle close to zero before transition and hence,
the discontinuity in the body angle trajectory was significantly smaller than the case where the legs adjust
controller was not used. Similarly, Fig. 17(b) shows
that the ball velocity upon transition is significantly
smaller when the legs adjust controller was used, thereby
resulting in a smoother transition from SSS to DSS.
The transition from DSS to SSS is achieved by performing the legs-down operation while balancing, and
by turning off balancing when the hoof switches hit the
floor. Selected frames of the automatic transition from
SSS to DSS and vice versa are shown in Fig. 18.

with no direct actuation on the body angle ω. This
section presents a trajectory planning algorithm that
exploits the natural dynamics of the system to plan body
angle trajectories, which when tracked by the balancing
controller enable the ballbot to achieve desired rest-torest motions on the floor.
From (1), the equation of motion corresponding to the
unactuated joint ω is given by
(α+βcos ωp )θ̈+(α+γ +2β cos ωp )ω̈p
βg sin ωp
−β sin ωp ω̇2p −
= 0, (14)
rw
which forms a constraint on the system dynamics, and
hence restricts the family of configuration trajectories
that the system can follow. It is a second-order nonholonomic constraint as it is not even partially integrable
(Oriolo and Nakamura 1991), and it is referred to as
a dynamic constraint. Any ballbot motion must satisfy
the dynamic constraint, and hence the trajectory planner
presented here uses the dynamic constraint equation to
plan a body angle trajectory, which when tracked will
result in the desired rest-to-rest motion on the floor.
The dynamic constraint in (14) can be re-written as
θ̈ = f (ω, ω̇, ω̈)
βg sin φ
+β sin ωω̇2 −(α+γ +2β cos ω)ω̈
= rw
. (15)
α + β cos ω
Equation (15) shows that changes in the body angle
can result in acceleration of the ball. Though it is not
integrable, one can numerically solve the equation to find
the ball angle trajectory that will result from tracking
any given body angle trajectory. Given the initial ball
angle θ0 and the desired final ball angle θfd , a body angle
trajectory ωp (t) for t ∈ [t0 , tf ] is planned, which when
tracked will result in a ball angle trajectory θp (t) such
that θp (tf ) = θfd .
A class of parametric trajectories is proposed for the
body angle that enables the robot to move between
static configurations, i.e., rest-to-rest motions. The ballbot must lean forward in order to move forward and

The balancing controller presented in Sec. V-A is
capable of keeping the ballbot upright, while the stationkeeping controller presented in Sec. V-B is capable
of making the ballbot stick to its position on the floor.
However, any attempt to use the stationkeeping controller to track a desired ball motion on the floor will
result in jerky motions as the controllers fight against
the dynamics of the system to achieve this motion.
This is because the ballbot is an underactuated system

effort. The constraints ω(tf ) = 0 and ω̇(tf ) = 0 are not
explicitly mentioned as they are automatically satisfied
when ω tracks ωp (t). In this paper, the optimization is
performed using Nelder-Mead simplex method (Nelder
and Mead 1964), which is a direct search method that
finds an optimal solution with just functional evaluations.
The planned body angle trajectory ωp (t) is obtained
by substituting the optimal parameters in (16). The
planned ball trajectory θp (t) is determined by numerically solving the dynamic constraint equation (14) using
ωp (t), ω̇p (t) and ω̈p (t). The optimization process finds a
body angle trajectory ωp (t) given by (16), which when
tracked will enable the robot to reach the desired ball
position θfd at time t = tf . It is to be noted that the
optimal parameters ωap1 , ωap2 and tf obtained by the
optimization process are sensitive to the initial parameter
values. The trajectory planner presented here was the first
successful planning algorithm on the ballbot. Since then,
we have explored more sophisticated trajectory planning
approaches that can generate body lean trajectories for
arbitrary desired ball motions on the floor. However, an
exclusive, detailed presentation of these approaches is in
review (Nagarajan and Hollis 2013).

lean backward in order to come to a stop. Using this
physical understanding of the ballbot motion, we follow2
(Rosas et al. 2002) to propose the following parametric
trajectory for the body angle shown in Fig. 19:
2t−tm−t0
2t−tf−tm
ωp(t) = ωap1 sech(k
)+ωap2 sech(k
)+ωp0 ,
tm −t0
tf −tm
(16)
where ωap1 , ωap2 are the amplitudes of the hyperbolic
secant functions, tm = (t0 + tf )/2, k = 9 is a constant
scalar and ω0p is chosen such that ωp (t0 ) = 0 and
ωp (tf ) = 0. Positive values for ωap1 and ωap2 will result in
a body lean trajectory that represents a lean forward and
lean backward motion of the body, which is necessary
for the robot to achieve a rest-to-rest motion.
Given ωap1 , ωap2 , t0 and tf , a smaller k value results
in a wider peak, whereas a larger k value results in a
narrower peak. The effect of varying k was significantly
smaller than the effect of varying other parameters, and
hence it was kept constant. Similarly, with no loss of
generality t0 = 0 was used. Therefore, the body angle
trajectory ωp (t) depends only on three parameters ωap1 ,
ωap2 and tf whose values have to be found such that the
resulting ball angle trajectory θp (t) reaches the desired
ball angle θfd at t = tf . For any set of parameters ωap1 ,
ωap2 and tf , the planned body angle trajectory ωp (t) is
given by (16) and the planned ball angle trajectory θp (t)
is obtained by numerically solving (15) with the initial
conditions (θp (t0 ), θ̇p (t0 )) = (θ0 , 0).
The trajectory planning procedure can now be formulated as an optimization problem. The goal is to find
parameters ωap1 , ωap2 and tf of the body angle trajectory
ωp (t) in (16) such that the objective function
# tf
J = w1 (θ(tf )−θfd )2+w2 θ̇2 (tf )+ (w3 t+w4 τ 2 )dt (17)

A. Feedback Trajectory Tracking Controller
Given ωp (t) and θp (t), the open-loop torque input
required to track the trajectories is obtained from the
equations of motion in (1). However, this open-loop
control input fails on the real robot due to modeling
errors, nonlinear friction effects, perturbations and wrong
initial conditions. In order to ensure accurate tracking
of the planned ball angle trajectory θp (t), a feedback
trajectory tracking controller is used as an outer loop
controller, similar to the ones described in Sec. V-B,
around the balancing controller.
The feedback trajectory tracking controller is a PID
controller whose gains were manually tuned. It feeds
back ball angle θ and outputs a compensation body
angle ωc to correct for the deviation of the ball position
from its desired trajectory θp (t). The balancing controller
tracks the desired body angle trajectory ωd (t), which
is a sum of the planned body angle trajectory ωp (t)
and the compensation body angle trajectory ωc (t), i.e.,
ωd (t) = ωp (t)+ωc (t). The feedback compensation terms

Large values are chosen for the weights w1 and w2 in

physical interaction characteristics of balancing mobile
robots in human environments. Sections V and VI presented the control architecture and the trajectory planner
that enabled the ballbot to balance, stationkeep, yaw
and achieve rest-to-rest motions. This section presents
experimental results that demonstrate the robustness of
the ballbot to physical disturbances that are inevitable
while operating in human environments. Moreover, the
dynamic stability of balancing mobile robots naturally
enable them to be physically interactive (Nagarajan et al.
2009b). This section also presents several interesting
physically interactive behaviors that were developed.

are saturated to avoid large values that might drive the
system unstable.
B. Experimental Results
The trajectory planning and tracking framework presented in this section was experimentally validated on
the real ballbot. The trajectory planning and optimization
was done offline using MATLAB. The dynamic constraint equations were numerically solved using ode45
in MATLAB and the Nelder-Mead simplex method was
implemented using f minsearch in MATLAB.
The planned body angle trajectories for a diagonal
motion of the ballbot along the floor moving 1.414 m at a
direction 20◦ from the body X-axis are shown in Fig. 21.
The feedback compensation trajectories and desired body
angle trajectories are also shown in Fig. 21. A video of
this motion can be found in Extension 1. The ballbot’s
successful tracking of the desired body and ball angle
trajectories are shown in Figs. 22−24. The body angle
data was obtained from the IMU, and the ball position on
the floor was calculated using the odometry information
from the ball motor encoders.

A. Ease of Mobility
It is desirable for robots operating in human environments to yield when pushed. Balancing mobile robots
react to a disturbing force to regain balance. Only a small
continuous applied force is required to move the robot
from one place to another, a behavior that is intrinsically
different from that of a statically stable robot. When the
ballbot is balancing, a continuous force as small as 3 N
is enough to keep the ballbot moving in any direction,
which implies that the ballbot can be moved around
with just a single finger as shown in the companion
video (Extension 1). Figure 25(a) presents the linear
velocity trajectories of the ballbot when pushed with
three different constant forces. For a 5 s constant push,
a 4.6 N force moved the robot from 0 to 0.23 m/s, while
a 11.5 N force moved it from 0 to 0.5 m/s, and a 20.4 N
force moved it from 0 to 0.82 m/s.

VII. H UMAN –BALLBOT P HYSICAL I NTERACTION
The objective of the work presented in this paper is to
explore the feasibility of developing dynamically stable
mobile robots that are human-sized, dynamically agile,
slender enough to easily maneuver cluttered environments and readily yield when pushed. The ballbot was
developed as a simple test bed to study locomotion and

with other objects in the environment while recovering
from the kick. Therefore, the ballbot uses a stopping
controller, which is essentially the velocity controller
described in Sec. V-B with zero desired velocity, to
bring the robot to rest in a shorter distance. Figure 26(b)
shows the ball velocity trajectory under the action of
the stopping controller when the ballbot was kicked
with about 310 N force for 0.4 s. Figure 27 shows the
composite frames from the companion video (Extension
1), wherein the ballbot successfully recovers from a kick
using the stopping controller.

Similarly, a balancing mobile robot can also be physically stopped with a small force when it is in motion.
This is a key feature for a robot operating in human
environments as it provides a natural way for humans to
physically control the movement of the robot and stop it
from running them over. Figure 25(b) shows the velocity
trajectories of the ballbot when it was physically stopped
while moving at 0.7 m/s and 0.75 m/s. A resisting force
of 38 N applied for 1.2 s brought the ballbot to rest from
0.7 m/s, while a smaller force of 24.7 N applied for a
longer time of 2.8 s brought the ballbot to rest from
0.75 m/s.
The companion video (Extension 1) demonstrates the
balancing capabilities of the ballbot and also presents
videos of physically moving and stopping the robot with
just a single finger. It is important to note that the ease
of mobility of a balancing mobile robot like the ballbot
comes naturally from its dynamic stability characteristics, and is not a programmed behavior. Moreover, it does
not require any extra sensing to achieve these physically
interactive behaviors. However, a statically stable mobile
robot needs other sensors, like cameras or tactile sensors
to detect human disturbances, and also needs specially
programmed behaviors to handle different scenarios.

C. Human Intent Detection
Humans are physically interactive with the objects in
their environments, and hence, the robots operating in
human environments will inevitably have physical interactions with them. These physical interactions can be
used to encode interesting robot behaviors. For example,
a soft push to the robot can be considered unintentional,
whereas a hard push to the robot can be considered
as a command to move away from its current location.
This section describes an approach to detect this human
intention and act accordingly.
The force exerted by a human on the ballbot directly
corresponds to its acceleration, which can be used to
differentiate a soft push from a hard push. The ballbot’s response to such human intentions is shown in
Fig. 28. The ballbot continues to stationkeep at its

B. Robustness to Large Disturbances
As shown in Sec. VII-A, the ballbot can be physically
moved with small forces. However, it is also important
for robots operating in human environments to be robust to large disturbances as well. While balancing, the
ballbot can successfully handle collisions with stationary
objects in the environment like furniture and walls, and
bounce back as shown in Fig. 26(a).
In case of large disturbances like a kick, the ballbot
is able to maintain balance, but under the action of only
the balancing controller, the robot will continue to move
in the direction of the push for a long time until the
damping friction of the floor slows it down and brings it
to rest. However, in cluttered environments, this behavior
is not desired as the robot will most likely collide

ancing mobile robots like the ballbot over traditional
statically stable mobile robots. However, there are a
number of challenges that remain to be addressed. One
of the fundamental challenges is in the safety of such
robots in human environments. The ballbot can fall down
due to hardware and software problems. Therefore, the
design, verification and guarantee of safety procedures is
a necessity for such systems before they can be reliably
deployed in human environments.
In the case of the ballbot, the legs are neither strong
enough to stop the falling robot, nor fast enough to be
rapidly deployed. The design of better leg mechanisms
with rapid deployments can be explored. Moreover, the
leg design should also guarantee that the dynamics of
the falling robot would not tip the robot over when
the legs are deployed. Redundant sensing and actuator
mechanisms like in the Segway (Nguyen et al. 2004) can
also be used to increase the safety margin.

given a hard push, it moves away and stationkeeps at
a different position 2 . In this experiment, any push
that produces a ball acceleration greater than 0.5 m/s2 is
considered a hard push. The companion video (Extension
1) demonstrates the ballbot successfully achieving this
behavior.
D. Ballbot Interface and Teleoperation

IX. C ONCLUSIONS

The ballbot has a highly interactive graphical user
interface that allows wireless teleoperation of the robot
using a joystick. The joystick commands desired velocities to the velocity controller presented in Sec. V-B.
The ballbot has been reliably teleoperated at fast walking
speeds for hundreds of meters over surfaces ranging from
vinyl tile to carpet to rough concrete to metal gratings.
The ballbot was successfully teleoperated on ramps with
angles up to about 4◦ as shown in Fig. 29(a) and also
over Ethernet cables on the floor as shown in Fig. 29(b).
The videos of successful teleoperation of the ballbot
can be found in Extension 1. The ballbot was able to
drive into and out of elevators and over the cracks and
misalignment between elevator cars and floors with ease.

The control implementations and their successful and
robust operation on the ballbot were demonstrated.
Planning body lean trajectories to achieve desired ball
positions was also demonstrated. Successful trajectory
tracking between static configurations was experimentally verified. Several interesting physical interaction
behaviors with the ballbot were also presented.

X. F UTURE W ORK
Future work include developing high-level motion
planning strategies to enable the ballbot to navigate in
human environments. This would require the addition
of extrinsic sensors to enable localization and object
detection in the environment to further enhance ballbot’s
locomotion and interaction capabilities. The work to
date opens up a wide range of possibilities for ballbot’s
actions. With these considerations, it is reasonable to
believe that the ballbot represents a new class of wheeled
mobile robots capable of agile, omnidirectional motion.
