Abstract— Multi-wheel statically-stable mobile robots tall
enough to interact meaningfully with people must have low centers
of gravity, wide bases of support, and low accelerations to avoid
tipping over. These conditions present a number of performance
limitations. Accordingly, we are developing an inverse of this type
of mobile robot that is the height, width, and weight of a person,
having a high center of gravity, that balances dynamically on a
single spherical wheel. Unlike balancing 2-wheel platforms which
must turn before driving in some direction, the single-wheel robot
can move directly in any direction. We present the overall design,
actuator mechanism based on an inverse mouse-ball drive, control
system, and initial results including dynamic balancing, station
keeping, and point-to-point motion.

I. M OTIVATION
A significant, but frequently overlooked problem is that
statically-stable wheeled mobile robots can easily become dynamically unstable. If the center of gravity is too high, or
the robot accelerates/decelerates too rapidly, or is on a sloping
surface, the machine can tip over. A robot must be tall enough
to be able to interact with people and the human environment
at a reasonable height. On the other hand, it must be skinny
enough to easily make its way around without bumping into
things or getting into peoples’ way.
Fig. 1 is a rough illustration of some venerable staticallystable robots currently in use in several research projects.
The rapid development of each one of these example robots
(and others which could be cited) was made possible by the
recent introduction of more-or-less standardized commercial
robot bases. In fact, this has been a tremendous boon to
researchers developing mobile robots capable of meaningful

interactions with people—permitting the mobility issue to be
safely “ignored,” while enabling workers to focus on their
respective application domains. (In earlier days, robot builders
by necessity were embroiled with the details of locomotion—
often for years—before moving on to the research topic of
interest.)
Fig. 2(a) depicts the case for a three-wheeled omnidirectional
base capable of omni-directional motion. The robot radius is
r1 , the effective wheel base is defined by r2 < r1 , and the
(surprisingly small) tipping moment arm is shown as d. The
four-wheel, generally nonholonomic base shown in Fig. 2(b)
has a somewhat greater tipping moment arm, but suffers from
the fact that some form of suspension must be incorporated to
ensure that all four wheels remain in contact with the floor.
In the side view of Fig. 2(c), the robot is moving to the
left and decelerating with wheel braking forces Fb1 and Fb2
acting on the body. In this case, F1 + F2 = mg, F1 d =
F2 d+(Fb1 +Fb2 )h, and the acceleration is a = (Fb1 +Fb2 )/m.
At the instant the robot decelerates, a plumb bob suspended
from the center of gravity will be vertical. If the braking occurs
too rapidly, as shown in Fig. 2(d), F2 = 0, F1 = mg, and
the moment Fb1 h will be unopposed. When the plumb bob
swings past the center of support at the forward wheel, the robot
will begin to tip over. The situation is exacerbated by uneven
floors and the fact that the effective robot radius is actually
somewhat greater than r1 to provide some margin of clearance
when passing obstacles. Further, when the robot moves, its
sensors (which must be located high on the body to interact
with people) are subjected to a great deal of random motion
because of the relatively small wheel bases, uneven floors, and
“give” in the suspension. If the robot has a manipulator that
can pick up and carry heavy objects the situation is even worse
because the center of mass and inertial properties are rapidly
changing [4].
In practice, to ameliorate these difficulties, these mobile
robots have (1) bases that are relatively wide with respect to
environmental dimensions, e.g., doorways (increasing d), (2)
have centers of gravity that are as low as possible (decreasing
h, often achieved by the inclusion of significant dead weight),
and (3) operate slowly enough to avoid tipping over (reducing
Fb1 and Fb2 ). This is not so bad for many purposes, but is
it really the best we can do? It is tempting to dismiss these
considerations as mere engineering details which are unimportant compared to the “real” classical problems dealing with
perception, navigation, cognition, interaction, etc. It would be

base, (b) four-wheeled base, (c) stability margin, (d) tipping moment during
acceleration or deceleration.

a mistake, however, to ignore the stability problem. Staticallystable wheeled mobile robots may be an evolutionary dead end
when it comes to operating in human environments.
What is needed are robots that are safe; agile and capable
of graceful motion; slender enough to easily maneuver in
cluttered, peopled environments; and which readily yield when
pushed around. It is surmised that intelligent machines of this
sort can only be achieved with dynamic stability. This idea
follows the model of humans and other animals which are
intrinsically dynamically stable.
II. BACKGROUND
A two-wheeled robot with inverse pendulum control developed in Japan was demonstrated in 1994 [6]. The two-wheeled
design eliminated the need for a third castoring wheel. The
same group introduced a one-wheel balancing robot [9]. The
wheel is a prolate ellipsoid like a rugby ball and is driven
with an axle along the major axis. The body of the robot
has a hinge above and perpendicular to this axis. The robot
balances in the forward/backward directions by application
of wheel torque in the manner of the two-wheeled design,
and balances from side to side by leaning the body left or
right at the actuated hinge. Recently, balancing wheel chairs1
and balancing 2-wheel “Segway personal mobility devices”2
have been introduced. The 2-wheel RMP robotic platforms
[10] based on the Segway are the subject of much recent
development in robotic locomotion.
The previous work on dynamically-stable rolling machines
provides inspiration for our current research, yet is distinctly
different. For example, there is no previous work proposing a balancing rolling machine whose body is supported
by a single omni-directional spherical wheel. The previous
rolling/balancing machines cannot immediately drive in a given
direction without first re-orienting the drive mechanism. For
example, a two-wheel balancing machine such as the Segway
RMP cannot maneuver in tight spaces by moving sideways; a
robot based on such a machine could not open and close a door
without knowing the precise location of the hinges in order to
establish the correct turning radius. The rugby-ball robot cannot
turn in place, but can only turn in a wide arc.

III. S YSTEM D ESCRIPTION
Ballbot, shown in Fig. 3, is a reconfigurable research platform developed and constructed to validate the notion of a
dynamically stable robot resting atop a single, spherical drive
wheel. It was designed to meet two goals: approximate the
dimensions of a human being, and create a platform that is
easily reconfigured for various present and future research
efforts. The body is a cylinder 1.5 m tall, with a diameter of
400 mm and a weight of 45 kg. Three aluminum channels,
held together by circular decks, define the structure of Ballbot’s
body. Three retractable landing legs are attached to the lower
third of the channels, which when deployed allow Ballbot to
remain standing after being powered down. Active components,
such as computing, power, and sensing, are mounted on the
decks, allowing these elements to be placed at varying positions
along Ballbot’s axis. Fig.s 3(a) and (b) show the design and
Fig. 3(c) shows its present configuration successfully balancing
and station keeping.
Ballbot is designed to be entirely self-contained; power is
supplied by a 48V lead acid battery with operating time of
several hours, and computing is performed on board by a
200 MHz Pentium processor. Communication with Ballbot is
through an 802.11b wireless link. A Crossbow Technology
VG700CA-200 Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) emulating a
vertical gyro provides Kalman-filtered pitch and roll angles and
rates with respect to gravity. The drive motors are connected to
Copley Model 412 PWM amplifiers, with 1024 cpr encoders
feeding motor shaft position back to the computer. Additionally,
1024 cpr encoders are placed on the passive rollers to measure
ball rotation. The IMU and encoders provide all data required
for full-state feedback control.
The drive mechanism, shown in Fig. 4, is essentially the
inverse of a mouse-ball drive: instead of the mouse-ball driving
the mouse rollers to provide computer input, rollers drive the

Fig. 4.

ball to produce motion. The initial ball was a 200 mm diameter
hydroformed steel shell covered with a 3.2 mm thick urethane
outer layer. We have fabricated balls with urethane formulations
of several different durometers. The ball is actuated by a pair of
12.7 mm diameter smooth stainless steel rollers placed orthogonally at the sphere’s equator. These rollers are linked through
timing belts to two high torque DC servomotors. Opposite the
drive rollers are two spring-loaded passive idler rollers that
apply force at the ball’s equator to maintain contact between
the drive rollers and the ball. This arrangement represents
a compromise since some slippage is always present. For
example, if one roller is being driven, the orthogonal roller must
be slipping. This simultaneously demands both a high-friction
and low-friction material for the ball. On the other hand, it is
always desirable to have high friction between the ball and the
floor. The drive works well but the initial ball eventually wore
out. A second ball design with a lighter 190.5 mm diameter
spun aluminum shell and 12.7 mm of urethane has unobservable
wear, presumably due to the lower shear stresses in the thicker
urethane layer. The entire drive mechanism is attached to the
body with a large diameter thrust bearing, allowing a third
actuator (currently not installed) to re-orient the body in yaw.
Finally, the entire Ballbot body rests on top of the ball on three
commercial low friction, omni-directional ball transfer devices.
IV. S IMPLIFIED BALLBOT M ODEL
For the purposes of developing a stabilizing controller, we
introduce and derive equations of motion for a simplified model
of Ballbot. In this model, the Ballbot ball wheel is a rigid
sphere, the body is rigid, and the control inputs are torques
applied between the ball and the body. There is no slip between
the wheel and the floor. Further, we assume that the motion in
the median sagital plane and median coronal plane is decoupled
and that the equations of motion in these two planes are
identical. As a result, we can design a controller for the full
3D system by designing independent controllers for the two
separate and identical planar systems.
It is worth making special note of the modeling assumptions
that are made regarding friction. Friction between the wheel
and the floor and between the wheel and the body is modeled
as pure viscous damping. Forces due to static friction and
nonlinear dynamic friction are neglected. The inclusion of a
viscous term in the friction model makes sense: there are

hysteresis losses associated with with the compression and
relaxation of the urethane layer that occurs at the ball-floor
and ball-roller contact points, and these losses can reasonably
be assumed to be velocity dependent. However the exclusion
of the effects of static and nonlinear dynamic friction is not
as easily justified, and we have determined experimentally
that these effects are in fact significant (see Section VII).
Still we choose to neglect these terms because they would
introduce discontinuities and extreme nonlinearities that would
render the resulting Ballbot model unusable for linear controller
synthesis. As described in Section V, the controller presented
here employs an inner PI loop to mitigate the effect of these
modeling omissions.
Fig. 5 is a diagram depicting the planar model. The Lagrangian formulation is used to derive the nonlinear equations
of motion for the simplified model (see, e.g., [3]). The first step
is to compute the kinetic energy Kb of the ball:

where Ib , mb , and rb are, respectively, the moment of inertia,
mass, and radius of the ball. The potential energy of the ball
is Vb = 0. The kinetic energy KB and potential energy VB of

where IB is the moment of inertia of the body about the center
of the ball, " is the distance between the center of the ball and
the center of mass of the body, mB is the mass of the body, and
g is the acceleration due to gravity. The total kinetic energy is
K = Kb + KB and the total potential energy is V = Vb + VB .
Define the system configuration vector q = [ ω φ ]T . The
Lagrangian L is a function of q and q̇ and is defined to be
L(q, q̇) = K − V.
Let τ be the the component of the torque applied between
the ball and the body in the direction normal to the plane. To
model the viscous friction terms, define the vector

model ball–ground and ball–body friction, respectively. Using

must be overcome to achieve velocity tracking, thus reducing
the effect of the unmodeled static and dynamic friction. The
integral term adds an extra state to the system. Define the
augmented state vector xa = [ xT x5 ]T . The closed loop
equations of motion of the inner loop can then be written as

The outer loop is designed by linearizing the inner loop
equations of motion and applying LQR (see e.g., [1]). Note
that the simplified Ballbot system is at equilibrium whenever
sin(ω + φ) = 0 and φ̇ = ω̇ = 0. The objective is to design
a controller that will balance Ballbot with the body straight
up and hold it in a fixed position ω = 0, which is equivalent
to stabilizing the equilibrium point at xa = 0. We begin by
linearizing the equations of motion about this point:

VI. I NITIAL R ESULTS
A number of tests were conducted to characterize physical
system performance, and to make comparisons with simulation.
During operation on a hard tiled floor, it was found that
the machine was able to balance robustly, strongly resisting
attempts to tip it over when a person applied torques to the
body. However, it was not able to simultaneously balance and
station keep. When operated on a carpeted surface, Ballbot was
able to do both, presumably due to the extra damping afforded
by the carpet material.
In the test run shown in Figs. 7 and 8, Ballbot was commanded to move from a starting position in a straight line to a
goal position. There is an initial retrograde ball motion causing
the body to lean toward the goal position, followed by a reverse
motion to stop at the goal. Differences between simulation and

experiment are probably due to unmodeled frictional and spring
forces. The divergence when station keeping is at most about
40 mm in position, and 0.5◦ in tilt.
To see the typical motion jitter experienced during operation,
one may plot the paths taken as the ball moves around on the
carpeted floor. Fig. 9 shows data taken from a 99 s run where
Ballbot was released slightly out of balance, which was rapidly
corrected by ball motion, followed by station keeping within
a roughly circular region of about 40 mm diameter. Fig. 10
shows Ballbot’s attempt to track a square trajectory.
The straight line path plotted in Fig. 11 was generated by
commanding Ballbot to move at a constant velocity for a period
of 40 seconds, demonstrating that we can specify trajectories in
terms of both desired position and desired velocity. This motion
is much slower that the motion depicted in the previous straight
line plot (Figs. 7 and 8) and in the square plot (Fig. 10). These
fast motions exhibit fairly straight trajectories because Ballbot
is essentially “falling” toward its goal, then recovering when it
reaches the goal. In contrast, the motion depicted in Fig. 11 is
slow, steady, and tightly controlled over the entire path.

The LQR controller presented here is sufficient to balance
Ballbot and drive it along rudimentary trajectories on carpeted
surfaces. These early capabilities fall short of the robust balancing and agile mobility that will be required in order for Ballbot
to operate effectively in human environments.
The overly simplified friction model is likely to be a major
reason for the poor performance of the resulting controller.

Our results are preliminary and there is much that remains
to refine Ballbot’s model and control. Nevertheless, it would
appear that Ballbot and its progeny might well represent the
vanguard of a new type of wheeled mobile robot capable of
agile, omni-directional motion. Such robots, combined with the
research community’s ongoing work in perception, navigation,
and cognition, could yield truly capable intelligent mobile
robots for use in physical contact with people.

and nonlinear dynamic friction on Ballbot behavior are significant. For example, the break-away torque necessary to
overcome static friction is nearly half of the maximum torque
that can be applied by the motor. Additionally, the frictional
effects are asymmetric; Ballbot moves in the reverse direction
much more easily than it moves in the forward direction. We
have developed a Ballbot actuation model that includes static,
Coulomb, and viscous friction as well as the observed asymmetry. This improved model matches experimentally observed
Ballbot motion significantly better than the pure viscous friction
model used in this paper (see Fig. 12). In future work, we will
use this model to guide the design of a more robust nonlinear
balancing controller. Specifically, we will investigate the use of
sliding mode control, which has been proven to be effective for
systems with high static friction [5].
In addition to designing new controllers, we will make a
number of mechanical modifications that will expand Ballbot’s
capabilities. One such modification is the installation of the
actuator to control the yaw of the Ballbot body. This actuator
controls the relative yaw angle between the body and the inverse
mouse-ball actuator at its base, and it relies on static friction
between the ball and the floor in order to control the absolute
yaw of the body. For the aluminum ball with a half-inch thick
coating of 70A-72A durometer urethane, we have measured the
yaw-axis break away torque between the ball and the floor to
be approximately 4.25 Nm on tile floor and 3.55 Nm on carpet.
The area of contact between this ball and the floor is a circle
with a diameter of 30mm. These values should be sufficient to
prevent the ball from slipping during yaw maneuvers.
We will also consider a redesign of the inverse mouse-ball
actuator. The observed asymmetry in the mouse-ball actuation
is due to force imbalance that results from driving the ball from
a single roller on the side. When the actuator moves forward,
the ball is pushed up into the body, increasing the friction
between the ball and body. When the actuator moves backward,
the ball is pulled down, away from the body, decreasing friction.
We will investigate designs that eliminate this asymmetry by
